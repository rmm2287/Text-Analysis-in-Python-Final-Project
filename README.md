# Understanding-311-Inquiries-In-New-York-City
Throughtout this project, 311 data was analyzed using text processing, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis. This analysis  shed light on the kinds of complaints and questions New Yorkers have when they reach out to the 311 Call Center. A range of issues were identified, like parking violations and water problems, with most calls leaning towards a negative sentiment. This supported the initial hypothesis that many inquiries are about personal frustrations rather than broader public concerns. Overall, this research highlights how important it is to analyze this data to get a better grip on urban challenges and trends in public service requests. Looking ahead, research could dive into seasonal patterns, mix in other data for more context, or even use predictive modeling to anticipate future service requests. By honing these analytical methods, city officials and researchers can better understand and respond to what New Yorkers really need, making urban life a bit smoother for everyone.
